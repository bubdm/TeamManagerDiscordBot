# TeamManagerDiscordBot
Public version of the discord bot I'm working on (removed personal information for safety). Written in C# and uses DSharp API. 

For commands to work properly:
1) Insert your own bot token in config.json file located at /bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/config.json
2) Make sure channel and categories names match the attributes for required channels and categories
3) For commands that ping, you'll need role specific IDs based on your discord servers role IDs
4) For personal pings, you need users personal discord IDs

Thanks to Dapper Dino for the YouTube tutorial videos on how to set up the bot and how to make certains commands.
